Description: This package contains two functions. The main function, cs, downloads and displays a selected RStudio Cheat Sheet in the RStudio Viewer pane. The second function, csOptions, prints the names of all the cheat sheets available at the RStudio GitHub; these names can be sent as character strings to the cs function. This package also installs RStudio Addins, allowing for cheat sheets to also be imported using the dropdown menu.
